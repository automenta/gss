Global Survival System is a model which...

 -Calculates whether a complete manifest of needs can be satisfied by the 'available' resources -- illustrating how a community is likely to thrive or suffer.

 -Suggests alternate means of satisfying a more essential need, when shortages occur; for example, by substituting an alternate source of a nutrient.

 -Attempts to provide a means of evacuation, if needs are not likely to be met

 -Analyzes physical locations

 -Provides methods for transitioning from one location to another

...in terms of the appropriateness of that method for a biological organism -- according to certain measurement heuristics.

This tool is simple to understand and free for all to use, modify, and improve.


Appropriateness...

  -of a given environment,

  -at a specific time,

  -for a specific organism (human, animal, or plant),

...may be calculated in terms of its needs.

The development of this tool is equivalent to a planetary constitution that can logically grant all beings equal rights to existence.
